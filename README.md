Anyways, here is my to do list.

==TO DO==
-Add a custom unit factory with all types of units.
Units will be:
 -3 of each type
 -Using magic
 -One unit that costs a ridiculous amount to make but is super op.
-Fix it so sectors don't require lead and copper to launch (I think that's still a thing)
-Add more uses for
 -Empty Gems
 -Steel
 -Wisps of Magi
-Add the following items to be made out of scrap
 -Turret
 -Router
 -Wall
 -Junction 
 -Power Node
-Add the following items made out of steel
 -Liquid Pump
 -Conduit
 -More turrets
 -Faster Conveyor
-Add the following items using gems and wisps
 -Fastest conveyor
 -Better walls
 -More turrets
 -Better everything
-Add a core that can be built by the player (maybe)
-Add a zone on serpulo that can be used to get all these items on serpulo, 
making them accessible in the rest of the campaign.
